# 🌌 Saturn Java

Welcome to **Saturn Java** — my personal space for exploring and building Java applications using Visual Studio Code.

## 🚀 Getting Started

This project is set up for Java development in **VS Code**. Whether you're a beginner or brushing up your skills, this structure is ready to help you focus on writing clean Java code.

## 📁 Folder Structure

- `src/` – Java source files
- `lib/` – Project dependencies
- `bin/` – Compiled `.class` files (generated automatically)

> You can change the folder structure by editing `.vscode/settings.json`.

## 📦 Dependency Management

Manage libraries and dependencies visually using the **JAVA PROJECTS** panel in VS Code.
